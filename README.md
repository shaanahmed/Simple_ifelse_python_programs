The if-elif-else statement in Python is used to make multiple decisions based on different conditions. 
It allows for more than two choices, giving flexibility to run different code blocks based on different conditions.

Syntax: 
if condition1:
    # Code to run if condition1 is True
elif condition2:
    # Code to run if condition1 is False and condition2 is True
else:
    # Code to run if all previous conditions are False

How It Works
The if block checks the first condition (condition1).
If condition1 is True, the code under this if block runs, and Python skips the rest.
If condition1 is False, it moves to elif (which means "else if") and checks condition2.
If condition2 is True, the code under this elif block runs.
If all conditions are False, the code under the else block runs.
